## Long Questions (Attempt any two – 2 × 15 = 30 Marks)

17. Define the Data Science workflow (process). List and explain each stage with examples of activities and tools used at each step. Why is the workflow considered iterative? (Refer to Unit 1 slides)
18. Given a CSV file of student marks, write a Python script using Pandas to:
    - Load the data
    - Handle missing values (fill with mean)
    - Filter students scoring above 75
    - Group by city and calculate average marks
    - Export the cleaned data to a new CSV file
    - Create a bar chart of average marks by city using Matplotlib.
19. Explain the difference between classification and regression in machine learning. List the main steps to build a simple classification model using any dataset of your choice.
