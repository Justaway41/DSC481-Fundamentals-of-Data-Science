2. What is the output of `10 // 3` in Python?
3. What keyword is used to define a function in Python?
4. What is the purpose of the `break` statement in a loop?
5. Which Python library is primarily used for structured data manipulation (e.g., DataFrames)?
6. List two modes for opening a file in Python.
7. What does the `isnull()` function do in Pandas?
8. Define 'mean' in statistics.

## Short Questions (Attempt any five – 5 × 10 = 50 Marks)

11. Explain the difference between a `while` loop and a `for` loop. Write a Python program to print the first 10 natural numbers using a `while` loop.
12. Describe the features of a Python Dictionary. Write a script to create a dictionary of three students and their ages, then print the age of a specific student.
13. Explain the importance of Exception Handling in Python. Write a code snippet to handle a `ZeroDivisionError`.
14. What are missing values? Explain two strategies to handle missing values in a dataset using Pandas.
15. Explain how to calculate the correlation between variables in a dataset. What does a correlation coefficient of 1 indicate?
16. Write a Python script using Matplotlib to plot a simple line graph showing the sales of a company over 5 years. Label the X and Y axes.

## Long Questions (Attempt any two – 2 × 15 = 30 Marks)

17. Describe the key steps in a Data Science Process (Life Cycle). Explain the importance of "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA) in this cycle.
18. Given a dataset `attendance.csv` containing `StudentID`, `Name`, `DaysPresent`, `DaysAbsent`, `TotalDays`, and `DateJoined`. Write a Python script using Pandas to:
    - Read the file.
    - Handle missing values (`DaysAbsent` with 0, `DaysPresent` with mean).
    - Remove duplicate rows.
    - Convert `DaysPresent`, `DaysAbsent`, and `TotalDays` to integers, and `DateJoined` to datetime.
    - Create `AttendanceRate` as `DaysPresent / TotalDays`.
    - Normalize `AttendanceRate` to a 0–1 scale.
    - Identify outliers in `AttendanceRate` using the IQR method.
    - Save the cleaned data to `attendance_cleaned.csv`.
19. What is Machine Learning? Explain the difference between Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. List the steps of a basic Machine Learning workflow and explain each step in 1–2 lines.
