## 6. Evaluation System and Students' Responsibilities

### Evaluation System

In addition to the formal exam(s), the internal evaluation of a student may consist of quizzes, assignments, lab reports, projects, class participation, etc. The tabular presentation of the internal evaluation is as follows.

| External Evaluation | Marks | Internal Evaluation                    |
| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Semester-End        | 50    | Class attendance & participation (5)   |
| Examination         |       | Quizzes/Assignments/Presentations (10) |
|                     |       | Project Work (10)                      |
|                     |       | Internal Term Exam (25)                |
| Total External      | 50    | Total Internal: 50                     |

### Students' Responsibilities

Each student must secure at least 45% marks separately in both internal assessment and practical evaluation with 80% attendance in the class in order to appear in the Semester End Examination. Failing to get such score will be given NOT QUALIFIED (NQ) to appear the Semester-End Examinations. Students are advised to attend all the classes, formal exam, test, etc. and complete all the assignments within the specified time period. Students are required to complete all the requirements defined for the completion of the course.
