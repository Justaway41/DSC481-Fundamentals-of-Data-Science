# Unit IV & V — Lab Exercises

Practice questions for:

- Unit IV: Functions & Modules
- Unit V: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Comprehensions)

---

## 1. Write a function that takes a name and returns a greeting string.

---

## 2. Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum of a list.

---

## 3. Write a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number.

---

## 4. What is the output of this code? Explain:

```python
def f(x, lst=[]):
    lst.append(x)
    return lst
print(f(1))
print(f(2))
```

## 5. Create a module file with a function to check if a number is prime, and import it in another script.

---

## 6. Given a list of numbers, return a new list with only the even numbers.

---

## 7. Given a tuple of numbers, return the sum of its elements.

---

## 8. Given two sets, find their intersection and union.

---

## 11. Given a list with duplicates, return a list with unique elements, preserving order.

---

## 12. Use a dictionary comprehension to invert a dictionary (swap keys and values).
